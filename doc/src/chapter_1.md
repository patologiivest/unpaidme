# Introduction


The goal of this project is to create a (more or less) universal data model for the domain of _pathology_, which
is centred around the notion of _events_ and thus provides a foundation to perform _process mining_ across
laboratories.

## Problem Statement

As with many domains within healthcare, also pathology is marred by the issue of lack of interoperability.
Traditionally, there was not a focus on interoperability among _laboratory information systems_.
Hence, there is no common data model or exchange format tha facilitates portability of data from one system to another.
